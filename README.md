My attempt at quiz game!

https://edgarmendez94.github.io/edgars-quiz/

This quiz game (when done correctly) should rely heavly on Java 

The html is mostly just a prety container that has some of its assets hidden due to the class added to them

The css should allow me to space out buttons , apply a consistent font throughout all elements 

I had to rely alot on the timer interval activity we did in class in order to recreate it in my quizTime function, it sets an initial time & puts it into a loop where its getting deducted every 1000 milliseconds while also displaying every sec as well

startQuiz utilizes the hide class i created , so that when I press it the class is removed from the element. It also calls the quiz time function , and calls for the next question.
